  <!--
    build-alt-configurations

    Builds against alternative supported configurations. The list of alternative
    configurations is defined to exclude the recommended configuration, which is covered by the
    build target. The purpose of this target is only to verify clean compilation. As
    such, unlike build target, this target does not perform any of the post-build
    processing or produce consumable binaries.
